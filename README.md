### First Application: Restaurant Search App

- The application prompts a user with a search bar at the top of the screen and the user can search for a restaurant, 
once we get the results from the search Yelp API we display the results in three sections on the screen based on restaurantâ€™s prices.

- Each of these three different sections scroll horizontally. Once a user taps on a restaurant we are going to take them to a detail page that displays a couple images of the given restaurant.
